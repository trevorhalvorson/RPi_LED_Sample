# Raspberry Pi LED Sample
This sample project demonstrates sending HTTP requests to a local Raspberry Pi server.
**See [Morse Code](https://github.com/trevorhalvorson/MorseCode) for setting up the Python server on
a Raspberry Pi. Note: the Raspberry Pi and Android device must be connected to the same network.**


## Setup
1. Edit line 29 of [Main Activity](../master/app/src/main/java/com/trevorhalvorson/rpiledsample/MainActivity.java)
to send requests to the correct IP address of the Pi.
2. Generate the APK and install it to your device.


Your Android device can now send HTTP requests to the local server.
